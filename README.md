[Advent of Code] - an advent calendar of programming puzzles.

I'll attempt to solve them with Kotlin.

### Day 1 Sonar Sweep

observe the measurements of a submarine.

### Day 2 Dive

navigate a submarine in the seas.

### Day 3 Binary Diagnostics

decode binary encoded reports.

### Day 4 Giant Squid

make sure a giant squid wins a game of bingo.

### Day 5 Hypothermal Venture

stay safe on the grid by finding the danger zones.

### Day 6 Laternfish

get a sense of exponential growth.

### Day 7 The Treachery of Whales

get a sense of coordination costs when fighting off a whale via a fleet of crabs in submarines.

### Day 8 Seven Segment Search

decode scrambled signals.

### Day 9 Smoke Basin

find spots on a map.

### Day 10 Syntax Scoring

help out syntax scoring algorithms.

### Day 11 Dumbo Octopus

find your way through a grid of bioluminescent octopuses.

### Day 12 Passage Passing

find all paths between start and end.

this one was hard for me. still need to wrap my head around traversing search and the exit conditions for recursive functions.

### Day 13 Transparent Origami

discover the hidden code by folding and merging points on a transparent sheet of paper.

### Day 14 Extended Polymerization

handle exponential insertions of symbols.

this one was hard for me again. see day 12.

### Day 15 Chiton

find the shortest path through a cave covered in chitons.

another fun one, especially if you kind of reinvent a poor man's dijkstra.

### Day 16 Packet Decoder

write a parser for the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System.

this was tough but rewarding.

### Day 17 Trick Shot

take probes in the sea. 

### Day 18 Snailfish

I had to give a pass on this one. Need to brush up on trees first.

### Day 19 Beacon Scanner

3d puzzle. I had to give another pass. Need to brush up on matrices and backtracking first.

### Day 20 Trench Map

a game of life style puzzle with a little twist, since the background of the world was flashing. 

### Day 21 Dirac Dice

a dynamic programming puzzle. 

### Day 22 Reactor Reboot

keep track of reactor cuboids.

### Day 23 Amphipod

a little, weird shortest path puzzle. need to revisit.

### Day 24 Arithmetic Logic Unit

went over my head, need to revisit.

### Day 25 Sea Cucumber

find your parking spot at the bottom of the ocean.
