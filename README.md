I'll attempt to solve them with Kotlin.

### Day 1 Sonar Sweep

observe the measurements of a submarine.

### Day 2 Dive

navigate a submarine in the seas.

### Day 3 Binary Diagnostics

decode binary encoded reports.

### Day 4 Giant Squid

make sure a giant squid wins a game of bingo.

### Day 5 Hypothermal Venture

stay safe on the grid by finding the danger zones.

### Day 6 Laternfish

get a sense of exponential growth.

### Day 7 The Treachery of Whales

get a sense of coordination costs when fighting off a whale via a fleet of crabs in submarines.

### Day 8 Seven Segment Search

decode scrambled signals.

### Day 9 Smoke Basin

find spots on a map.

### Day 10 Syntax Scoring

help out syntax scoring algorithms.

### Day 11 Dumbo Ocotopus

find your way through a grid of bioluminescent octopuses.

### Day 12 Passage Passing

find all paths between start and end.

this one was hard for me. still need to wrap my head around traversing search and the exit conditions for recursive functions.

### Day 13 Traansparent Origami

discover the hidden code by folding and merging points on a transparent sheet of paper.

### Day 14 Extended Polymerization

handle exponential insertions of symbols.

this one was hard for me again. see day 12.
